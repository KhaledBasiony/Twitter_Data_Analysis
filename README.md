# Twitter_Data_Analysis

This is my submission to the Data Wrangling project in Udacity's Data Analysis Professional Nanodegree.

Here we focus on gathering, assessing, cleaning, and analyzing twitter data from a page called WeRateDogs, which essentially posts pictures of cute dogs, describes them, and gives them an insane rating.
The pictures are fed to a classification model to predict which type of dog it is, and then the results are provided in a text file.

In the Act_Report you can find quick insights after gathering and cleaning the data.

If you are trying to do the Udacity project, feel free to check my solution, but please don't copy it :)
